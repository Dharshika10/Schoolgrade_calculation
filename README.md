# Schoolgrade_calculation

I developed a web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that converts numerical grades into letter grades for students.
In HTML, I utilized both internal CSS and internal JavaScript for this project.
The application features a home page and a login page with the username "suji" and password "suji@123". After submitting, users are directed to a calculation page and can then proceed to a sign-out page.
.This application is also responsive and handles invalid inputs to ensure a smooth user experience.
