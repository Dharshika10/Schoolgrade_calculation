# Schoolgrade_calculation

I developed a web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that converts numerical grades into letter grades for students. 
The application includes a home page, a login page with the username 'suji' and password 'suji@123'. Upon submitting, users are directed to a calculation page and can then navigate to a signout page.
